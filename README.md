# Pacman-Style Game

This repository contains a Java implementation of a Pacman-style game with custom upgrades and a graphical user interface. The game includes dynamic upgrade mechanics, a robust scoring system, and a GUI built with Java Swing.

## Features

- **Dynamic Board Sizes**: Configure the game board size anywhere from 10x10 to 100x100 cells.
- **Custom Upgrades**: Includes at least five different complex upgrades that appear randomly, enhancing gameplay and strategy.
- **Graphical Interface**: Utilizes `JTable` for rendering the game board and custom models derived from `AbstractTableModel`.
- **Score and Time Tracking**: Real-time updates for score, time, and lives within the game interface.
- **High Score Management**: High scores are recorded and persisted using Java's `Serializable` interface.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Interrupt gameplay with a Ctrl+Shift+Q shortcut to quickly return to the main menu.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, the main menu will be displayed with the following options:

- **New Game**: Start a new game session. You will be prompted to select the board size.
- **High Scores**: View the high scores from previous sessions.
- **Exit**: Close the game application.

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move your character around the board.
